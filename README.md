## Description
This application creates a team roster consisting of a Manager, and any number of Engineers and Interns. The user is prompted to create a Manager, and then subsequently to pick the members of the team and assign pertinent, individual details. When the user is complete, an HTML roster of all employees and their information is generated.

## Installation
From your terminal, navigate to the proper folder:

/template_engine/develop

then run:  node app.js  

## Usage
User experience is self-guided. Upon launch, you will be prompted to create a Manager. Once you have created a manager you will be asked which type of team member you would like to add, and you can navigate the answers with your arrow keys. Use the arrow keys to highlight the option you want (e.g. Engineer) and press 'Enter' to select. When you are finished, select "I do not want to add any more team members" to build your team.

You can view your HTML team roster at:

/template_engine/develop/output/team.html
